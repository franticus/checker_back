Card Deck:Each deck must contain 52 cards without jokers, including all four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades) and all numbers from two to ace. &#9989; 3. Card distribution: At the beginning of the game, each player receives 13 cards. The remaining cards remain in the deck. &#9989; 4. Purpose of the game: The object of the rummy game is to make combinations of cards and get rid of all your cards, either by scoring the least number of points. &#9989; 5. Card combinations: Cards can be combined into the following combinations: sets (three or more cards of the same rank, but of different suits) and sequences (three or more cards of the same suit and in ascending or descending order of rank). &#9989; 6. Points: Each card has its own value in points. Aces are worth 1 point, cards from two to ten are valued at face value, and jacks, queens and kings are worth 10 points each. Players should strive to collect combinations with the fewest points. &#9989; 7. Game Progress: The game begins by discarding one card face up onto the game table to create an open deck. Each player then takes turns either taking one card from the face-down deck or taking the last face-up card from the face-up deck. After this, the player can make valid combinations and fold to the table. The turn passes to the next player. &#9989; 8. End of the game: The game continues until one player gets rid of all his cards. Then the player declares \"rummy\" and receives 0 points.
