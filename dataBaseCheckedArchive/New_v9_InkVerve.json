You can schedule a tattoo appointment by contacting us via phone, email, or by visiting our studio in person. Our friendly staff will assist you in selecting an available time slot that suits your schedule. Do I need to pay a deposit to book an appointment? Yes, we require a deposit to secure your tattoo appointment. The deposit amount may vary depending on the size and complexity of the tattoo. This deposit will be deducted from the final cost of your tattoo. Can I bring a design idea for my tattoo? Absolutely! We encourage our clients to bring in their design ideas, references, or sketches. Our talented artists will work with you to bring your vision to life and ensure that you're completely satisfied with the final result. How long does a tattoo appointment typically last? The duration of a tattoo appointment can vary depending on the size, complexity, and placement of the tattoo. On average, appointments can last anywhere from 1 to 4 hours. Your artist will provide you with a more accurate estimate based on your specific design. What should I do to prepare for my tattoo appointment? To ensure a smooth tattooing experience, we recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating a good meal before your appointment. It's also essential to avoid consuming alcohol or drugs before your session. Wear comfortable clothing that provides easy access to the area being tattooed, and be sure to communicate any concerns or questions with your artist beforehand. Is there anything I should avoid after getting a tattoo? After getting a tattoo, it's essential to follow your artist's aftercare instructions carefully. This typically involves keeping the tattoo clean and moisturized, avoiding direct sunlight and swimming for a few weeks, and refraining from picking or scratching the tattooed area. It's also crucial to avoid consuming alcohol or drugs during the healing process, as they can interfere with your body's ability to heal properly.

Follow these guidelines to ensure your tattoo heals properly and retains its vibrant colors: Keep it clean: Wash your tattoo gently with mild soap and water several times a day to prevent infection. Pat it dry with a clean towel, and avoid rubbing or scratching the area. Moisturize: Apply a thin layer of fragrance-free moisturizer to your tattoo to keep the skin hydrated and prevent dryness. Avoid petroleum-based products, as they can clog pores and hinder the healing process. Avoid direct sunlight: Protect your tattoo from prolonged sun exposure, as UV rays can cause fading and damage to the skin. Apply a high-SPF sunscreen to your tattoo whenever it's exposed to the sun. Avoid swimming: Refrain from swimming or soaking in water for at least two weeks after getting your tattoo. Pools, hot tubs, and bodies of water can harbor bacteria that can lead to infection. Avoid tight clothing: Wear loose, breathable clothing over your tattoo to prevent irritation and allow it to breathe. Avoid tight clothing that can rub against the tattoo and cause discomfort. Avoid picking or scratching: Resist the urge to pick at scabs or scratch your tattoo, as this can damage the healing skin and affect the final appearance of your tattoo. Following these aftercare tips will help your tattoo heal properly and look its best for years to come. If you have any questions or concerns about caring for your tattoo, don't hesitate to contact us for guidance. Home Prices Tattoo Care About Us Contact Us Privacy Policy Terms & Condition",
