Power levels: Microwave ovens have different power levels that allow you to cook food at different temperatures. Defrost function: This function allows you to defrost frozen food safely and evenly. Convection cooking: Some microwave ovens come with a convection cooking feature that uses a fan to circulate hot air around the food, resulting in more even cooking. Grill function: Some microwave ovens come with a grill function that allows you to brown and crisp food. Sensor cooking: Some microwave ovens come with sensors that detect the moisture level in food and adjust the cooking time accordingly.
