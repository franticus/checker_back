Instruction 1. Separate Colors Always separate your clothes by color before washing to prevent color bleeding and fading. Wash whites, light colors, and dark colors separately to maintain their vibrancy. 2. Read Care Labels: Before washing, carefully read the care labels on your garments to ensure proper care. Follow the recommended washing instructions, including water temperature, cycle type, and any special care requirements. 3. Use Appropriate Detergent: Choose a detergent suitable for the fabric type and washing machine. Use a gentle detergent for delicate fabrics like silk or wool, and opt for a color-safe detergent to preserve the brightness of colored clothing. 4. Handle Stains Promptly: Treat stains as soon as possible to prevent them from setting in. Blot stains with a clean cloth and apply a stain remover according to the product instructions. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can spread it further. 5. Use Proper Washing Techniques: Avoid overloading the washing machine to ensure thorough cleaning and prevent wrinkles. Use the appropriate water temperature and cycle setting for your garments. For delicate items, consider using a mesh laundry bag for added protection. 6. Air Dry or Tumble Dry: Check the care labels to determine whether garments should be air-dried or tumble-dried. Hang clothes to air dry on a clothesline or drying rack to prevent shrinkage and preserve their shape. If using a dryer, select the appropriate temperature setting to avoid damaging delicate fabrics.
