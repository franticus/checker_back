    "rugs": "RugBazaar - Finest Indian Rugs | Handmade Carpets | Contemporary Designs | About our rugs Home About our rugs Contact us Call us Choosing the Perfect Rug Understanding Your Needs Choosing the perfect rug for your home is an important decision. Before you start shopping, take some time to consider your needs. Think about the size of the room, the existing décor, and the amount of foot traffic the area receives. This will help you narrow down your options and find a rug that meets your specific requirements. Consider the function of the room when selecting a rug. For high-traffic areas like the living room or hallway, you'll want a durable rug that can withstand heavy use. In bedrooms and dining rooms, you may want a softer, more plush rug for added comfort. Once you have an idea of what you're looking for, consider the style of rug that best suits your home décor. Do you prefer traditional, oriental-style rugs with intricate patterns and rich colors? Or do you lean towards more modern, minimalist designs with clean lines and neutral tones? Take into account the color scheme of your room when choosing a rug. A rug should complement the existing colors and patterns in the room without overwhelming the space. If you have a bold, colorful room, you may want to choose a rug with a more subtle design. Alternatively, if your room is more neutral, you can use a rug to add a pop of color and interest. Finally, don't forget about the size of the rug. A rug that is too small will look out of place and won't properly anchor the room. As a general rule, aim to leave at least 18 inches of bare floor around the edges of the rug. In a large room, you may even want to consider using multiple rugs to define different areas. Where to Shop Once you have an idea of what you're looking for, it's time to start shopping. There are many places where you can buy rugs, both online and in-store. Online retailers offer a wide selection and often have lower prices, but you won't be able to see or touch the rug before you buy it. In-store retailers, on the other hand, allow you to see the rug in person and often offer more personalized service. When shopping for a rug, be sure to read reviews and do your research to ensure that you're getting a quality product. Look for retailers that offer a wide selection, competitive prices, and good customer service. At RugBazaar, we take pride in offering you the finest collection of Indian rugs, each handcrafted with traditional expertise and contemporary designs. Our rugs are made from the highest quality materials and are designed to add warmth, beauty, and elegance to any space. With our easy ordering process, secure payment options, and fast, reliable shipping, you can shop with confidence at RugBazaar. And if you ever have any questions or concerns, our friendly customer service team is always here to help. The Art of Rug Making Traditional Craftsmanship Indian rugs are renowned for their exceptional quality and craftsmanship. Each rug is handcrafted by skilled artisans using traditional techniques that have been passed down through generations. From hand-knotting to hand-tufting, these time-honored methods ensure that each rug is a unique work of art. One of the oldest and most traditional methods of rug making is hand-knotting. In this technique, individual knots are tied onto the warp threads of the rug, creating the pile. Hand-knotted rugs are known for their durability and longevity, as well as their intricate designs and rich colors. Another popular method of rug making is hand-tufting. In this technique, a design is drawn onto a canvas backing, and the yarn is punched through using a tufting gun. The pile is then sheared to create a smooth, even surface. Hand-tufted rugs are often more affordable than hand-knotted rugs, but they can still be of excellent quality. At RugBazaar, we are committed to preserving the traditional art of rug making while also embracing modern design trends. Each rug in our collection is handcrafted using the finest materials and the highest quality craftsmanship. Whether you choose a traditional wool rug or a more contemporary silk design, you can trust that your RugBazaar rug is made to the highest standards of quality and beauty. Quality Materials At RugBazaar, we use only the finest materials to create our rugs. From luxurious wool to sumptuous silk, we source the highest quality materials to ensure that our rugs are not only beautiful but also durable and long-lasting. Wool is a popular choice for rugs because of its natural durability and resilience. It is also naturally stain-resistant and easy to clean, making it an excellent choice for high-traffic areas. In addition to wool, we also offer a range of other materials, including silk, cotton, and jute. Silk rugs are known for their luxurious feel and lustrous sheen, while cotton and jute rugs are more affordable and easy to clean. Whatever your preference, you can trust that your RugBazaar rug is made from the highest quality materials and designed to last for years to come. Why Choose RugBazaar?
