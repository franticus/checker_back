The scent is beautifully crafted and lasts long. I bought it for my anniversary, and my wife was thrilled. It's now her favorite fragrance, and she wears it every day. Ava Velvet Vanity has outdone themselves with Enchanted Essence. It’s become my signature scent. The longevity is impressive, and I love the way the scent evolves throughout the day. Highly recommend! Olivia The fragrance is amazing and has a great balance between freshness and warmth. It’s versatile enough for both day and night. My only complaint is that the bottle is a bit heavy to carry around, but it's worth it for the beautiful design. Joseph Bought this as a gift for my wife, and she adores it. The scent is both elegant and alluring, making it suitable for any occasion. She loves how it makes her feel confident and sophisticated. Definitely a hit in our household. FAQ What is Velvet Vanity?
