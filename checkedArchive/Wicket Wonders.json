Installation Enable Unknown Sources Download the \"WicketWonders.apk\" Install the \"WicketWonders.apk\" Rules Cricket is a popular sport played by two teams of eleven players each on a rectangular field. The game is played with a bat and ball, with the objective being to score runs and prevent the opposing team from doing the same. Here are the basic rules of cricket: Batting: The batting team sends two players to the field at a time. The goal is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. The batsmen can be dismissed by being caught, bowled, lbw, run out, stumped, or hit-wicket. Bowling: The bowling team tries to get the batsmen out by delivering the ball to the batsman's wicket. The bowler can be dismissed for a wide, no-ball, or by being caught or run out. Fielding: The fielding team aims to limit the number of runs scored by the batting team. Fielders must work together to catch the ball, prevent runs, and dismiss the batsmen. Overs: In cricket, each team gets a set number of overs to bat and bowl. An over consists of six legal deliveries bowled by one bowler. Runs: Runs can be scored by running between the wickets, hitting boundaries (four or six runs), or by penalties given by the bowling team. Extras: Extras are runs awarded to the batting team without the player hitting the ball. These include wides, no-balls, and byes. Innings: A cricket match consists of two innings, one for each team. The team that scores the most runs wins the match. Toss: Before the match begins, a coin toss is held to determine which team will bat or bowl first.
