View prices Our Story & Mission We started City Workspaces to reinvent the future of work in India. We believe that work should empower people, not restrict them. And an office is more than just a place – it’s a platform to cultivate meaningful relationships. Back in 2018, we opened our first humble center in Bangalore focused on building a hospitality-driven space for digital nomads, freelancers, and solopreneurs. The amazing community and bonds formed amongst members showed us coworking’s tremendous impact. Today, City Workspaces facilitates over 42 centers nationally, from enterprise headquarters to indie creative shops. Underlying them all is our fundamental values of trust, accessibility, unity, wellbeing. We nurture local economic development alongside entrepreneurship and innovation. We provide the foundation for people to manifest their life’s work. So you can transform your dreams into reality. Surrounded by supportive communities that uplift and inspire. Uniting dreamers, doers, trailblazers to advance how the world works and lives. 19, RN Mukherjee Rd, Esplanade, B.B.D.
