Accept WHAT IS THE BACKING FUND AND WHY IS IT NEEDED FOR POKER PLAYERS? 1 The first reason for slow rate of progress on limits is chasing. If a player does a chase, it can slow down their progress on the next limit for several months and more. 2 The back fund is a chance to increase limits independently of chasing and even down swings in poker. The speed of progress on the limit depends only on the current level of play. 3 Once a participant is ready to play at a higher limit, we provide the necessary conditions. These conditions allow you to maximize your potential and achieve success in poker. 4 You can climb from NL20 to NL100 in 2-3 months provided that dispersion does not hinder success. After the contract ends, you have a chance to play at middle limits and a sufficient level of play to play them successfully! 5 In the Backing Fund, you do not need deposits. We finance your poker and provide conditions for moving to the next limit. As a result, you can play each limit for 2-3 weeks! THE PROCESS OF BUILDING TRAINING AND BACKING IN POKER? 1 You get access to a training cabinet with video recordings and statistics, and excellent conditions for playing poker 2 Next, you need to play 5K hands in the desired poker discipline. After that, you sign up for an individual training session 3 Then, the tutor checks your homework and analyzes your poker game online. 4 Every 10K hands, the tutor checks the training base. And if all tasks are completed, your balance is replenished to play on the limit above. 5 Then, the entire cycle repeats. Are you still hesitant? Sign up to our top trainer right now! No room limit!

You are in full control of the fund, and the responsibility for the decisions made remains with you. Start training Join Our Poker Fund and Maximize Your Potential What is the cost of training players at NL2, NL5 - 3, 5, or 15 dollars? And how much do players at these limits earn per month - 50, 70, or 100? Now let's consider mobile club poker apps where the competition is much weaker. This means that an NL2 player from a regular room can confidently play at NL10 in apps, and an NL5 player can confidently play at NL20. And if players improve their skills, they can play at even higher limits and win against even bigger players. Only the persistent and forward-thinking are able to earn passively as much as they do actively by conducting training sessions for a fixed fee. “Active approach” means the need to work here and now. “Passive approach” is the result of cumulative actions and in the future, does not depend on immediate actions.
