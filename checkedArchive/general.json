Discover how these AI-powered speakers work, their features, and how they're changing the way we interact with technology. Read More Smart speakers, such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, have gained popularity due to their ability to perform various tasks using voice commands. These devices utilize artificial intelligence to understand and respond to user queries, control smart home devices, and play music or podcasts.
