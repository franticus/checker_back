Here are some tips to help you care for your blooms: Keep your flowers in a cool place, away from direct sunlight and drafts. Change the water in the vase every two days, and make sure to trim the stems at an angle before placing them back in the water. Avoid placing your flowers near fruit, as the ethylene gas produced by the fruit can cause them to wilt prematurely. Seasonal Flowers We love celebrating the changing seasons at PetalWish, and we strive to offer a selection of flowers that reflects the time of year. Please note that some flowers may only be available during certain seasons. If you have your heart set on a particular type of flower, we recommend placing your order well in advance.
