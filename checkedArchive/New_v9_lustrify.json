We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience, and we take great pride in the quality and craftsmanship of our products. However, before you make a purchase from our site, we ask that you take a moment to read the following disclaimer. First and foremost, it is important to note that all of our chandeliers are intended for indoor use only, unless otherwise specified. They should not be exposed to outdoor elements such as rain, snow, or extreme temperatures, as this can cause damage to the product and potentially pose a safety hazard. Additionally, it is crucial that all chandeliers are installed by a qualified electrician. Improper installation can lead to electrical issues, fire hazards, and other safety concerns. Lustrify is not responsible for any damages or injuries that may occur as a result of improper installation. When it comes to the care and maintenance of your chandelier, it is important to handle it with care. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials when cleaning, as this can damage the finish and overall appearance of the product. We recommend using a soft, dry cloth to gently dust the chandelier on a regular basis. It is also important to note that while we strive to accurately represent the color, size, and overall appearance of our chandeliers on our site, there may be slight variations due to factors such as lighting and monitor settings. If you have any concerns about the accuracy of a product's representation, please do not hesitate to contact us for additional information. At Lustrify, we take great care in packaging and shipping our products to ensure that they arrive to you in perfect condition. However, in the event that your chandelier arrives damaged, please contact us immediately so that we can assist you in resolving the issue. We ask that you inspect the package upon delivery and notify us of any damages within 48 hours of receipt. Please be aware that Lustrify is not responsible for any damages or injuries that may occur as a result of misuse or improper handling of our products. This includes, but is not limited to, using the chandelier in a manner that is not intended, hanging items from the chandelier, or attempting to repair or modify the product without proper knowledge and experience. Chandeliers have been a symbol of luxury and elegance for centuries, and at Lustrify, we are proud to continue this tradition by offering a wide selection of high-quality chandeliers to suit any style or taste. From classic crystal chandeliers to modern, minimalist designs, we have something for everyone. Crystal chandeliers have long been a popular choice for those looking to add a touch of glamour and sophistication to their home. The intricate, sparkling crystals create a beautiful, shimmering light that can instantly elevate any space. At Lustrify, we offer a wide range of crystal chandeliers in various sizes and styles, from traditional to contemporary. Whether you're looking for a grand, statement piece for your dining room or a more understated fixture for your bedroom, we have the perfect crystal chandelier for you. If you prefer a more modern aesthetic, we also offer a selection of sleek, minimalist chandeliers. These fixtures feature clean lines and simple shapes, making them the perfect choice for those who prefer a more understated, contemporary look. Our modern chandeliers are available in a variety of materials, including metal, glass, and wood, so you can choose the perfect one to complement your existing decor. In addition to our crystal and modern chandeliers, we also offer a range of other styles, including rustic, industrial, and transitional. Our rustic chandeliers feature natural materials such as wood and iron, and are perfect for creating a warm, cozy atmosphere in your home. Our industrial chandeliers feature exposed bulbs and metal finishes, and are ideal for those who want to add a touch of edgy, urban style to their space. And our transitional chandeliers blend traditional and contemporary elements, making them a versatile choice for any home. At Lustrify, we understand that choosing the right chandelier can be a daunting task. That's why we offer a range of helpful resources to assist you in making the best decision for your home. Our buying guides provide detailed information on the different types of chandeliers available, as well as tips on how to choose the right size and style for your space.

Whether you're looking to create a cohesive lighting scheme throughout your home or simply want to add a touch of ambiance to a specific room, we have the perfect solution for you. When it comes to choosing a chandelier, there are several factors to consider. First and foremost, you'll want to think about the size of the room where the chandelier will be installed. A chandelier that is too small will get lost in a large space, while one that is too large will overpower a smaller room. As a general rule of thumb, you'll want to choose a chandelier that is approximately one foot in diameter for every 100 square feet of room space. By making a purchase from Lustrify, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this disclaimer and agree to use our products in a safe and responsible manner. If you have any questions or concerns about this disclaimer or any of our products, please do not hesitate to contact us at lustrify@gmail.com.
