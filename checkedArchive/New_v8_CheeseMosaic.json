The Visionary Beginnings It all began on a vibrant Mumbai morning in the spring of 2015 when two cheese aficionados, Rajesh Mehta and Anjali Singh, decided to turn their passion into a purpose. With a shared dream and a wealth of experience in the culinary arts, they embarked on a journey to create a cheese haven unlike any other – thus, Cheese Mosaic was born. Opening Doors to Cheese Artistry On the 1st of October, 2015, the doors of Cheese Mosaic opened for the first time in the heart of Mumbai's dynamic culinary scene. The founders' vision was clear: to introduce a boutique cheese experience that would celebrate the diversity and richness of cheese from around the globe, tailored to the Indian palate. Crafting the Mosaic Rajesh, with his extensive travel and taste for global flavors, brought to the table a selection of the world's finest cheeses. Anjali, with her deep understanding of the local cuisine and culture, infused the collection with a selection of Indian artisanal cheeses. Together, they curated a mosaic of cheeses that were not just food, but stories – each slice a page from a diary of flavors. A Legacy of Passion and Excellence Cheese Mosaic is more than just a store; it is a destination that reflects the founders' passion for excellence and quality. Rajesh and Anjali's commitment to sustainability, education, and community has turned Cheese Mosaic into a beloved brand, synonymous with the finest cheese experience in India. Welcome to Cheese Mosaic – where every cheese has a story waiting to be told. Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of Indian cheeses and enjoy their exquisite taste and aroma.
