Choose A Variety Of Players When you create a team, you should pick players that consistently perform well and those that are a surprise package. The most important thing to look at is the player’s current form when you are drafting their team. They may have a good reputation but may not be playing well at present, so you must be aware of their stats. Do Not Be Biased It is easy to want to draft a team with players you personally like in each game. But this is a biased decision that could cost you. You must instead look at how these players are performing and only choose the top-scoring players who are doing consistently well in their present games. Check The Benched Players When you start creating your winning team of 11 players, you must not include players that are constantly benched. That is why it is important to get a good grasp of the game you are competing in to see which players have been benched all season or have been recently benched. Keep an eye on the team reports and then choose the players. If you are not sure about a player, do not choose them till the final match lineup has been announced. Pick A Good Captain The captain of your virtual team will earn you 2X points, and the vice-captain will earn you 1.5X points. Therefore, it is necessary that you select these players wisely, as they could greatly add to your total points and help you rank higher. Look at the performance of the players and then see who could lead your team in the current match in the best way.
