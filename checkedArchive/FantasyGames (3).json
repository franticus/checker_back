Your team will start accumulating points based on the performance of players on the ground. This includes all aspects of the game such as scoring runs, taking wickets, goals, fouls, high strike rate, low economy rate, etc. At the end of the match, the users with the highest points will win cash prizes based on their rank on the contest leaderboard. Few Tricks to get you started with Fantasy Games Fantasy games are skill-based games where you have to use your analytical skills and knowledge to assemble a strong team of 11 players. On the First Games App, you can play a variety of fantasy sports like cricket, football, kabaddi and basketball and win big cash prizes. Here are some tricks to help you get started with online fantasy games . Choose A Variety Of Players When you create a team, you should pick players that consistently perform well and those that are a surprise package. The most important thing to look at is the player’s current form when you are drafting their team. They may have a good reputation but may not be playing well at present, so you must be aware of their stats. Do Not Be Biased It is easy to want to draft a team with players you personally like in each game. But this is a biased decision that could cost you. You must instead look at how these players are performing and only choose the top-scoring players who are doing consistently well in their present games. Check The Benched Players When you start creating your winning team of 11 players, you must not include players that are constantly benched. That is why it is important to get a good grasp of the game you are competing in to see which players have been benched all season or have been recently benched. Keep an eye on the team reports and then choose the players. If you are not sure about a player, do not choose them till the final match lineup has been announced. Pick A Good Captain The captain of your virtual team will earn you 2X points, and the vice-captain will earn you 1.5X points. Therefore, it is necessary that you select these players wisely, as they could greatly add to your total points and help you rank higher. Look at the performance of the players and then see who could lead your team in the current match in the best way. Play Practice Games You should play as many practice games as you can on the First Games App as a warmup to the actual games. It will give you an idea of how the game actually plays out and how you can gain points. You can create different teams with different captains and see how many points you can get and then change the players to see if it will help your scores. Look At The Playing Field Before any game, you must always look at the weather conditions and the field they are playing on. This can greatly affect the players you choose and the game results. For instance, if you are playing a game of fantasy cricket on the First Games App, you should check the cricket field in the match report. If the pitch is dry, you should pick players who can play well in such conditions and opt for more spinners. Therefore it is necessary to see the pitch report before you choose your final 11. Keep A Lookout For Injuries You should also keep checking the news to see if any players have been injured. If you form a team with injured players, your points can take a beating. Look at the news and hear the captain’s announcement, as this can tell you the final lineup of players. You can then make your fantasy team accordingly. Check The Pre-Match Report You should always go through the match report to see who is playing, who is injured and what the match will be like. You will get a basic idea of what the captain is thinking and can formulate your team accordingly. Take Calculated Risks In fantasy games, there is always some risk involved, but you should try and make sure that you calculate all possible outcomes. This is because you can either win or lose big in such games, and calculating all possibilities and risks will help you stay on point. For instance, if you are choosing a risky player in your team, you should see how much it will cost you if he fails. Always weigh the price value to the results and then take calculated risks. With the help of these tips and tricks, you can start playing a variety of fantasy games on the First Games App and start winning big today!

RUMMY 2.0 GAMEPLAY Rummy 2.0 is a new format of card game which can normally be played in a group with minimum two players. It uses a 52- card pack with or without jokers.

However each player has to put in a wager to enter the game and which is similar to Ante in Poker. Every player also takes a minimum buy-in amount to the pot money and as the game progresses the pot money grows and is won by the winner having completed the sequence. When the game starts players after placing the cards, every player will have the following options – ‘Call’ and match the already wagered amount by other players and then pick the card. ‘Raise’ the new wager amount and then pick the card. ‘Drop’ the game if the player thinks more wagering can lead to loss. Same as Drop in any Rummy format today. ‘Check’ into the next turn if the player does not want to initiate a new round of wagering. All subsequent players will have the above options and the round progresses until one player makes a valid declaration and wins the game. All the wagering made by players including initial minimum wager/Ante gets added to the main pot. If a player makes invalid declaration, he loses the game and remains dropped for the rest of the game. Wager he made so far remains in the main pot.

It is an online ludo game for multiple players &amp; requires an internet connection. Play Loodo with random players without having to hunt for a partner. User your strategy and skills in this board game and to win prizes. Every player is provided with four pawns each and a single dice is shared. How to Play: Each Loodo game can be played amongst two or four players. Each Player will be given 4 pawns. All the pawns are initially in the open position. A Player can roll the dice and start moving his pawns. The Player with the maximum score is the winner at the end of the Game. The Players are scored in the following manner: Each movement of the pawn per box from the starting point will be calculated as one point. Players score is calculated by adding the points of all the pawns of the Player. To win the game, you must be first in the leadership board and have maximum points. Each Player will have 10 seconds for his turn. If the Player doesn't move in this window, his turn will be randomly moved. If a Player skips his turn for 3 times, he will lose the Game and will be removed. A Players pawn can be ousted from the game and sent back to the starting point, if another Players pawn moves to the same box where the former Players pawn is placed, ie kill the opponents pawn. There are 8 dedicated safe boxes in the game where a pawn cannot be ousted. These cells are marked with a star. Players are entitled to an extra chance i.e. extra roll of dice in the following cases: When a Player rolls a six on the dice. When a Player ousts another Players pawn. When a Player pawn reaches home. If a Player rolls a six on the dice three times in a row, the extra chance will not be given after the third roll. Points &amp; Scoring: Normal Moves: - move 1 tile and score 1 point, which means for each tile moved score increases by 1 point for each move. Kill a pawn: - If the player's pawn lands on an opponent's pawn, the opponent's pawn is sent back to their starting position (except in case the opponent has his 2 pawn’s on the same tile which creates a safe zone or in 8 safe boxes in the game where a pawn cannot be ousted.) and the points of that opponent’s pawn gets deducted and that score is added to the pawn which inflicted the cut. The total score of the cutting pawn will now be its original score plus the points of the pawn that got cut. Reach Home: - each pawn reaching home gets 2X of the point value of that pawn. The current points for each pawn on the board will be visible to all players at all times. Player’s score is calculated by adding the points of his pawns on the board when the timer ends and the points value of the pawns that reached home.
