Sports Betting Rules 17.1 Khiladi.com accepts bets or/and wagers for sporting events that are presented on the Website. All such bets/wagers are subject to the rules applicable to each sport, e.g. Basketball, Tennis, E- Sports, etc. 17.2 You cannot make wagers exceeding your Account balance. 17.3 Once a bet has been placed and confirmed, a user cannot change or cancel a bet. It is therefore in the user’s interest to ensure that all details of their bet are correct before placing a bet. 17.4 Before an event starts, Khiladi.com reserves, at its own discretion, the right to void or cancel part or whole of a bet even after its acceptance without providing any reason to the user. After the event start, Khiladi.com reserves, at its own discretion, the right to void or cancel part or whole of a bet, even after its acceptance if there is a valid reason for this, such as: - a mistake in the wording (palpable error) of the event, odds or starting time; - the user attempt to bypass Khiladi.com limits (potential payout) and risk management by placing multiple, identical or similar bets or opening multiple Accounts; - the user is getting an advantage of any public announcement or secret information he has access to that determines the outcome of the bet; - the user combines related bets; - the user is actively participating in the event, e.g. as a Player, Referee, Manager or has direct or indirect relationship with events participants; - Website suffers a technical error offering wrong odds or events; - any other valid reason duly communicated to the user upon request. 17.5 . Khiladi.com reserves the right to cancel all bets of an event, if there is any change regarding the venue of the event. 17.6 Khiladi.com reserves the right to cancel all bets if there are radical changes in the circumstances of an event such as the length of playing time, the distance in a race speed or the number of periods, etc. 17.7 Winnings will be credited to the user Account following confirmation of the final result. 17.8 The outcome of a market is settled once this is determined. Khiladi.com takes the right to settle the game results in case a market is not determined earlier in the game. This rule works in terms of the normal duration of the match being concluded and if no any conditions are stated in the market description on the Website. For example: Example 1: Match-winner 1X2 market of an event is determined after the end of the normal duration (regular time) of the event. Football (Soccer) 1x2 Match Winner is determined after the 90 min, including any extra minutes called by the referee of the match as “normal duration”. When the game is played in Overtime (the regular time cannot determine the winner), all markets state that this is a subject to pay “include overtime” after completion of the game. If there are any penalty kicks (or other decisive moments) they’re not taken into consideration, unless another stated in the market. If the beginning of the game is delayed for whatever reasons, the event can be kept open and all bets can remain open 48 hours from the official start time. Nevertheless, Khiladi.com reserves the right to void such bets on its direction and refund the Users’ stakes back. All bets can remain open and be calculated due to the game results by the decision of Khiladi.com when the organizer continues the abandoned event within 48 hours after starting time. In case the abandoned event does not continue with the decision of the organizer within 48 hours after its starting, Khiladi.com will settle all determined markets that were completed on the pitch. In addition, Khiladi.com will cancel another and refund the stakes to players. There are exceptions to the general rule: The 48 hours rule is not supported in the Tennis games. All bets are available until the referee or official representative determines the winner. Nevertheless, there are cases in which a player retires. In this situation, all markets that are determined on the court are settled accordingly and all the rest declared void and stakes returned to players. If there are any doubts about the retirement of a player before the last point is concluded, the market of the match winner is cancelled. Nevertheless, all markets that relate to the specific sets or games that are determined, are settled accordingly. Baseball games. The 48 hours rule is supported. When two teams are playing 2 games in a row they are considered as Game 1 and Game 2 and will be settled as chronologically played with all bets valid. For the avoidance of doubt, if Team A plays Team B twice, the result of Game 1 will count for bets offered on Game 1 as originally scheduled and the result of Game 2 will count for bets offered on Game 2, as originally scheduled. The 48 hours rule is valid. (e.g. if a football match is abandoned in the second half, the markets of the first half will be settled normally). (e.g. in the example above, the markets of the second match have not decided) will be void and stakes will be refunded to customers. 17.9 Explanation of specific Betting Types If there is at least one Scorer when the match is abandoned, all bets made on the first Goalscorer will be applied and on the last will be canceled. A player will be determined as a winner according to Goalscorer market at any time, and other players’ bets are void. Head 2 Head Bets These bets mean the prediction about taking the higher position, getting more points or results between two players. Head 2 Head bets will work if both players will do the best in the event. If two players get the same result or play out a draw, all bets will be void. Outright Bets These bets mean the prediction about taking the higher position, getting more points or results among the players (3+). Outright bets will work if all participants will actively take part in the event. If there are participants that do not take part in the event, all odds that were placed on other participants will be amended and settled with a reduction in the odds. The reduction includes the same margin applied to the missing participants. If two or more participants take the same result (play in a draw), the applicable odds will be equal to the accepted odds divided by the number of tie participants (e.g. with equal odds 2.70 and three tie participants the final odds will be: 2.70 / 3 = 0.90), unless the official representative chooses only one winner with an additional statistic criterion (e.g. assists). Booking markets These are yellow and red cards. The yellow one counts as one card and the red - two. If a player gets two yellow cards in a row that are changed into a red card, this counts as three cards. In general, a player cannot receive more than three cards. A settlement will be based on all available card data that will appear during the normal event’s playing time. The cards are shown after the final whilst won’t be considered. The cards of a player who did not take part in the game (players that have already been replaced, coaches, players on the bench who have not taken part in the game) will not be considered. Booking markets with points In general, a player cannot get over 35 points during the game. A yellow card brings 10 points, the red one is counted as 25 points, and the second yellow-red card– 25. The second yellow card for a player who leads to a red card is not counted. Corners The corners are considered for the relevant market settlement only if they have been taken. If the corner is given but not taken, it will not be counted. Intervals The period from 00:01 until the completion of the minute indicated as the end minute is stated as the first interval. To exclude doubts, the interval 1-15 min is considered the period from 00:01 to 15:00 and the interval 30-45 min is considered the period from 30:01 until the end of the First Half accordingly. The interval 75-90 min is considered the period from 75:01 to the end of Full Time. The referee on its direction considered the last time interval from the minute indicated until the end of the period. 17.10 Bets by order and from bookmakers as well as betting agents are not permitted. Bets on events in which the bettor is participating (“participating” in this sense relates to those persons involved as a sportsperson, athlete, as an owner, trainer or functionary of a participating club) or those which are commissioned by any person participating, are not permitted. In addition, bets on league, cup or other events in which the respective club/ organization is participating may not be placed or commissioned by those persons considered to be participating in the respective event.
