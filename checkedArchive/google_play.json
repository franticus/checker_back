Keep up the good work. Though the real time notification have been slow lately. Nevertheless I can't imagine my life without this app. ðŸ’¯% would recommend to anyone. Udpate 13/7/2021: Liked the new inclusive all sports news feed but I'll like the old font size. This one is just way to big. Need to scroll up just to read 3 sentences. Please add font size option if possible. 874 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful? Yes No LiveScore Limited July 13, 2021 Hey there, thanks for taking the time to leave us a 5-star review and for your feedback. We strive to improve our app and certainly keep an eye out for future updates. Thanks again. - Team LiveScore Rocky K22 Flag inappropriate Show review history February 2, 2021 This is a very good football score tracking app but now it's size is increased very fast. It used to be a very lite app. I downgraded to an earlier version that I had saved in my phone because latest version is even bigger in size. A 64gb internal storage smartphone cannot install lots of 100+ mb size apps. Recently all the apps are eating lot of space. Android apps have even become bigger in size than Windows apps. Android need to look into this issue. Though this app is my go to sports app. 188 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful?

Like a goal scored in football, or a wicket taken/a 100 scored in cricket, or an amazing point won in tennis. Something like that. Thank you. 1,312 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful? Yes No LiveScore Limited September 11, 2021 thanks for taking the time to leave a review.
