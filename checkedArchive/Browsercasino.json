Place du Casino After several months of renovations, the Place du Casino has finally revealed its new look—a modern, open space entirely redesigned to accommodate visitors. And with spring now upon us, this beating heart of the Principality is the perfect place for a lovely stroll, where you can enjoy the impressive architecture, the high-end shopping, and the delicious food. #1 A new look for a legendary square A wonderful surprise awaits anyone returning to the legendary Place du Casino. Gone is the famous “camembert”, as the locals affectionately called it. The grassy knoll that previously occupied a good portion of the space has been replaced with an elegant beige-stoned esplanade, which offers a clear view of the lavish Belle Époque buildings in the area, including the Hôtel de Paris Monte-Carlo, the Café de Paris Monte-Carlo and the Casino de Monte-Carlo. The architect of this transformation is landscape designer Michel Desvigne, who was previously known for redesigning the Boulingrins Gardens. His new square embraces the old, evoking its original look from 1850. The Sky Mirror by Anish Kapoor, a fixture of the old square, remains at the centre of the esplanade, surrounded by a circular fountain designed like a small oasis. And with the flatter terrain, it now reflects the elegant silhouette of the Hôtel de Paris Monte-Carlo. Enjoy the view... #2 New palm trees, for a taste of summer year-round To retain a touch of greenery, the new Place du Casino features an elegant row of twenty palm trees. Just like the trees on the hotel patio, the palms can be entirely relocated for a concert or festival thanks to a system of removable paving stones. Next time you’re out for a walk, take some time to imagine this square transformed for some extravagant event—the kind that only Monaco knows how to throw. #3 Relax, sit back and take in the vibes While the square is soon open to pedestrians, its new design still leaves room for vehicle traffic—especially along the Hôtel de Paris Monte-Carlo, where the legendary Formula 1 Grand Prix track has been left intact. Parking spaces, meanwhile, have naturally been maintained, which means that residents and guests alike can continue the time-honoured tradition of admiring the country’s most stylish vehicles under the Monegasque sun. Meanwhile, at the Café de Paris Monte-Carlo, the surrounding space is reserved for pedestrians, giving the terrace an appreciable calm. Soon we’ll all get to go back there for a lovely chat with friends, a bit of coffee, or a nice snack... #4 One Monte-Carlo & the Boulingrins Gardens: take some time for yourself While the new Place du Casino is undeniably the beating heart of Monaco, it’s also the ideal starting point for a shopping spree into the brand-new One Monte-Carlo district. An extraordinary venue also offering a conference centre designed for your professional and private events. The good news is that the country’s high-end shops will be re-opening their doors on 5 May. Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Hermès…feel free to browse around and treat yourself to something nice. After all, you’ve earned it. And when you’re done, why not take some time for a lovely stroll along the lusciously green Boulingrins Gardens?

Reviews A bright, beautiful place, both inside and outside! Entrance to the casino is 18€. Near the casino you can admire a variety of machines! I highly recommend it for tourists to visit! William Johnson Perfect💖! The place is imbued with beauty and good mood! I didn’t notice the pathos, everything is taken for granted. We were there during the day, so there were no women in floor-length dresses and no men in suits, unfortunately. Entrance to the casino hall costs 18 euros, upon presentation of a passport, of which 10 euros can be spent at the bar (glass of wine, juice, cola) or in slot machines (a ticket with a bar code is inserted into the machine’s validator). It’s interesting to watch people’s excitement... In reality, we could have walked away with a big win at the top, but no one did that 😂 We didn’t win anything, but we were left with impressions and a good mood. recharged! I recommend! Emily Smith The area in front of the casino is very small, but very cozy. In its center there is a parabolic mirror, near which there is a constant queue of people who want to capture themselves in this mirror against the backdrop of the casino. Sophie Anderson Very cool place I immediately remember the films in which this casino was James Brown It’s nice, there are a lot of machines, there is a roulette and a couple of tables. There is a VIP room and a terrace for smoking players.
