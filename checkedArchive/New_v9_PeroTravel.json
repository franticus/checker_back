During one trip you can see the sights of several cities at once, and it will cost almost several times less than a classic sightseeing tour with overnight stays in hotels. Jeeping This is a trip in all-terrain vehicles overcoming natural obstacles; it is an extreme sport and recreation, which involves driving a tourist route off-road in vehicles. Yachting This is the same as a cruise on a liner or a trip on a ferry, only on a yacht there is more freedom, the size of the vessel is several times smaller, there is no annoying crew, you can feel like a captain yourself, stand at the helm. This is where you will feel the greatest open spaces Canyoning This is an extreme sports type of recreation, which consists of overcoming canyons (flooded or not) with the help of climbing and other equipment, and sometimes wading, but without boats or other watercraft Choose an excursion on our website that is right for you and sign up online without queues, simply and quickly!
