Players aim to beat the dealer with a three-card hand, making it an exciting and straightforward game for both beginners and experienced players. RULES Players place their bets on the \"ante\" circle, and each player and the dealer are dealt three cards face down. Players can then choose to fold, forfeiting their ante, or play, placing a \"play\" bet equal to their ante in the \"play\" circle. The dealer must have a queen-high hand or better to qualify. If the dealer doesn't qualify, players win even money on their ante bets, and the play bets push. If the dealer qualifies and beats the player's hand, the player loses both the ante and play bets. If the player's hand beats the dealer's hand, the ante bet pays even money, and the play bet pays according to the payout table. If the player and dealer tie, both the ante and play bets push. Players can also place a \"pair plus\" bet, wagering on whether they will be dealt a pair or better, with payouts based on the strength of their hand. Three Card Poker offers high payouts for strong hands like straight flushes and three of a kind, adding to the game's excitement. With its simple rules and fast-paced gameplay, Three Card Poker is a popular choice among casino players seeking a thrilling poker-based experience.

    "how-to-play__baccarat": "Baccarat - Learn how to play Rooms Restaurants Activities Casino Contacts Learn how to play Baccarat Baccarat Baccarat is a card game where players can bet on the player's hand, banker's hand, or a tie. The game has straightforward rules, making it popular among both novice and experienced players. RULES Players place their bets on the player, banker, or tie before the cards are dealt. Two hands are dealt—the player hand and the banker hand—each receiving two or three cards. Face cards and tens have a value of zero, while all other cards are worth their face value, with the ace valued at one. If either the player or banker hand totals 8 or 9, it's called a \"natural,\" and no more cards are drawn. If the player's hand is 5 or less, they draw a third card. Otherwise, they stand. The banker's play depends on their hand and the player's hand if the player drew a third card. The hand closest to 9 wins, with ties resulting in a push for banker and player bets but not for tie bets. Winning bets on the player or banker are paid at even money, while a winning tie bet typically pays 8 to 1 or 9 to 1. A commission is usually charged on winning banker bets, typically around 5%. Baccarat is a game of chance, and players don't need to make any decisions beyond placing their bets, making it easy for beginners to enjoy.

The objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over. RULES Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards, with players' cards typically facing up and one of the dealer's cards facing down. Players can choose to \"hit\" (receive another card) or \"stand\" (keep their current hand). Players may also have options to \"double down\" (double their bet and receive one more card) or \"split\" pairs (if dealt two cards of the same value). If a player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose their bet. The dealer must hit until reaching a total of 17 or higher and must stand on 17 or higher. A natural blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) usually pays 3:2. If the dealer and player have the same total, it's a push, and the player's bet is returned. Insurance is offered when the dealer's upcard is an Ace, allowing players to protect themselves against a potential dealer blackjack.

    "how-to-play__roulette": "Roulette - Learn how to play Rooms Restaurants Activities Casino Contacts Learn how to play Roulette Roulette Roulette is a popular casino game where players bet on the outcome of a spinning wheel. The wheel contains numbered pockets, and players can wager on specific numbers, colors, or groups of numbers. RULES Players place bets on the roulette table before the wheel is spun. The dealer spins the wheel in one direction and a small ball in the opposite direction. Winning bets are paid according to the corresponding odds for the type of bet placed. Common bets include straight-up (single number), split (two adjacent numbers), and outside bets like red/black or odd/even. If the ball lands on a pocket corresponding to a player's bet, they win. The house edge varies depending on the type of roulette game being played (e.g., European, American). Players can make multiple bets on each spin. After the dealer calls \"no more bets,\" no further wagers can be placed for that round. Some casinos offer special rules like En Prison or La Partage, which reduce the house edge on even-money bets. Roulette is purely a game of chance, and each spin is independent of previous spins. OTHER GAMES This content is intended for individuals aged 18 and above.

They come in various themes and formats, offering entertainment for players of all preferences. RULES Players insert coins, tokens, or credits into the machine and spin the reels by pulling a lever or pressing a button. Winning combinations are determined by the position of symbols on the reels, with specific combinations paying out predetermined amounts. Slot machines may have multiple paylines, and players can choose how many lines to bet on per spin. Some slot machines feature bonus rounds, free spins, or special symbols like wilds and scatters, enhancing the gameplay and potential winnings. Progressive slot machines pool a portion of each bet to create a jackpot that grows until it's won by a lucky player. Each spin of the reels on a slot machine is independent and randomly generated by a computer program, ensuring fairness and unpredictability. The paytable displayed on the machine shows the payouts for different symbol combinations and indicates any special features or bonuses. Players can choose the denomination of coins or credits they wish to bet, as well as the number of coins per line. Slot machines often feature vibrant graphics, sound effects, and animations to enhance the player experience and immerse them in the game.
