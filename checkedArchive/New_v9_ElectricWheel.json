Our approach is proactive; we send out a replacement scooter immediately, ensuring as close to zero downtime as possible.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law. &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.
