Our dedicated team ensures that every detail is carefully managed and that the final product reflects the high standards of VideoVivid. Trust us to transform your ideas into compelling visual stories that resonate with your audience and stand out in todayâ€™s competitive market. Our Process How We Work 1. Preparing for shooting Every successful video shoot begins with careful preparation. We collect all the necessary materials and develop a script that will structure all the work. It is important to take into account the details: from choosing the location to preparing the props, as they determine the final result in different countries. We also always discuss their expectations and ideas with the client in order to see them as accurately as possible. In addition to the script, we create a storyboard that helps visualize each frame. This allows us to imagine in advance what the final product will look like and make the shooting process more standardized. In the process of preparation, we are also developing a list of necessary equipment, which concerns future delays at the sites. 2. Disassembly process Filming is the most intense and interesting stage. We always create a comfortable environment for all participants so that they can relax and realize their potential. Typically a shoot will follow a pre-planned plan, but we can also be flexible in adapting to changing conditions or unexpected ideas that may arise along the way. During filming, we pay attention not only to the technical aspects, but also to the emotional side. Working with actors and participants is very important, and we constantly create an atmosphere of trust so that they can experience genuine emotions. This, in turn, makes the final material more vibrant and memorable. 3. Post-production After filming is completed, an equally important stage begins - post-production. Here we edit the footage, select the best takes and create a single story that will be interesting to the audience. It is important not only to place the accents correctly, but also to think about how the music and sound will support the good mood of the video. Editing is also the time for applying various effects and color correction, which gives the material a finished look. We approach this to ensure that each project creates a strong impression and meets quality standards, so we pay attention to every detail. In addition, at this stage we open the possibility for clients to carry their rights and proposals. 4. Finalization and distribution When the video is ready, we move on to finalizing the project. This includes creating a variety of distribution formats, from social media to company presentation materials. We look at where and how video will be used to tailor it to each platform. Once the video is ready for distribution, we work with clients on a promotion strategy. This may include creating social media, running ads, or posting videos on different platforms. We understand that a good video is not only about high-quality filming and editing, but also its proper distribution, which helps to achieve the desired goal.
