    "backing": "Master Poker Skills at ChipMasters - Online Training What is backing? Personal fund Contact Welcome to the Exciting World of Poker Understanding Backing Funds and Their Importance for Players Cashouts Impede Progress: A major factor in slow advancement through poker limits is frequent cashouts. Regular cashouts can set back a player’s progress to the next limit by several months or even longer. Steady Limit Advancement: A backing fund allows players to progress through limits regardless of cashouts or downswings. The rate of climbing the limits is determined solely by the player’s current skill level. Support for Higher Limits: When a player is ready to move up, we provide the necessary conditions. These conditions help players realize their full potential and achieve success in poker. Fast Track to Higher Limits: With optimal conditions and minimal variance, a player can advance from NL20 to NL100 within 2-3 months. After completing the contract, you'll be ready to play independently at mid-level limits with the skills needed for success. No Upfront Costs: Training with the Backing Fund requires no initial financial investment. We cover your play and provide the necessary conditions to move up limits. This way, you can advance through each limit in as little as 2 weeks to 2 months. The Training and Backing Process in Poker Explained Access to Training Materials: Gain access to a dashboard with training videos and statistics, offering excellent conditions for poker improvement. Homework and Game Review: To unlock the next lesson, your coach will review your homework and analyze your online poker gameplay. Regular Performance Evaluations: Every 10k hands, your coach reviews your hand history. If all criteria are met, your balance is topped up to play at a higher limit. Ongoing Development: This cycle repeats continuously, ensuring consistent growth and advancement through poker limits.

This opportunity is particularly advantageous for online poker coaches. We handle the lucrative deals, operational tasks, experience sharing, and player balances, allowing you to concentrate on recruiting players and managing their training. You have full control over the fund, and the responsibility for decision-making is entirely yours. Submit your request WE INVITE STAKING POKER FUNDS, POKER SCHOOLS, AND POKER COACHES TO PARTNER WITH US What is the cost of training players at NL2, NL5 - $3, $5, or $15? And how much do players at these limits earn per month - $50, $70, or $100? Now, let's consider mobile club poker apps, where the competition is much weaker. This means an NL2 player from a traditional room can comfortably play at the NL10 limit in apps, and an NL5 player can comfortably play at the NL20 limit. If players enhance their skills, they can play at even higher limits and compete against stronger opponents. Only those who are diligent and forward-thinking can earn as much passively as they do actively by conducting training for a fixed fee. An \"active approach\" means working here and now. A \"passive approach\" is the result of cumulative actions and, in the long run, does not depend on immediate efforts.
