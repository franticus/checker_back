Our beds are designed to provide optimal support and comfort, but they may lose their shape or become less comfortable over time if not properly cared for. Here are some general tips for caring for your SnuggleSpace bed: Use a mattress protector to prevent spills and stains from seeping into the mattress. Rotate your mattress every three to six months to prevent sagging and uneven wear. Do not jump or sit on the edges of the bed, as this can damage the frame and support system. Clean your bedding regularly, using mild detergent and warm water. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the fabric and reduce its lifespan. Do not expose your bed to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, as this can cause the materials to break down and lose their shape. Environmental Sustainability At SnuggleSpace, we are committed to reducing our environmental impact and promoting sustainable practices. Our beds are made with eco-friendly materials, such as natural latex, organic cotton, and recycled steel. We also use minimal packaging and prioritize energy-efficient manufacturing processes. We encourage our customers to join us in our sustainability efforts by recycling their old bedding and mattresses, using eco-friendly cleaning products, and reducing their energy consumption. Together, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
