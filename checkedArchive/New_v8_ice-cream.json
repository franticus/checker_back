    "about": "Mango Mantra: The Story of Our Indian Ice Cream Legacy ICE CREAM ABOUT US CONTACT US Mango Mantra: Celebrating India's Fruit Heritage In the heart of bustling Mumbai, amidst the colorful chaos and vibrant streets, Mango Mantra was born out of a simple yet profound love for Indian fruits and the timeless tradition of ice cream making. Founded in 2015 by culinary visionaries Aarav and Priya, Mango Mantra was their dream to encapsulate the essence of India's rich fruit heritage in the form of artisanal ice cream. The duo embarked on a quest to create ice creams that were not just desserts but a celebration of India's bountiful fruits and spices. They traveled across the country, from the lychee orchards of Bihar to the saffron fields of Kashmir, gathering inspiration and ingredients to bring their vision to life. Each flavor of Mango Mantra is a story, a memory from their travels, carefully crafted to capture the authentic taste of India.
