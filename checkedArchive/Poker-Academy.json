Accept POKER ACADEMY: UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF LIMITS FOR POKER PLAYERS 1 The journey to higher limits in poker can be a long and challenging one. The slow rate of progress on limits is often due to the need to chase, which can slow down progress for several months or even more. 2 At Poker Academy, we offer an alternative. The Backing Fund allows you to independently increase your limits, regardless of chasing or swings in poker. The speed of progress on the limit is solely dependent on the current level of play, allowing you to maximize your potential and achieve success in poker. 3 Once a participant is ready to play at a higher limit, we provide the necessary conditions. These conditions enhance your chances of success in poker and enable you to climb the limits ladder with ease. 4 You can climb from NL20 to NL100 in just 2-3 months with consistent play and discipline. After the contract ends, you have the opportunity to play at middle limits and achieve success at those levels too! 5 In the Backing Fund, you don't need deposits. We finance your poker and provide the conditions necessary to move to the next limit. As a result, you can play each limit for just 2-3 weeks! NAVIGATING THE JOURNEY TO BECOME A MASTER POKER PLAYER WITH POKER ACADEMY 1 Embark on your journey to become a master poker player by unlocking the doors to our comprehensive training cabinet, filled with video recordings, statistics, and ideal playing conditions. 2 To progress to the next limit, you'll need to accumulate 5K hands of exceptional poker discipline. Once you've completed this task, sign up for an individual training session with our expert trainers. 3 Our trainers will carefully analyze your game by reviewing your homework and conducting online poker analysis. They'll provide you with personalized feedback and guidance to help you improve. 4 After every 10K hands, our trainers will assess your training base. If all tasks are completed to the highest standard, your balance will be replenished to play at the next limit. 5 Repeat this cycle of learning and progressing, and you'll become a master poker player with Poker Academy.
