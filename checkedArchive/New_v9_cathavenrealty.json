We act as a facilitator, connecting potential buyers and sellers with each other and providing relevant information to assist in the decision-making process. However, all negotiations, contractual agreements, and legal obligations lie solely between the respective parties involved in the transaction. It is essential to note that the information provided by Cat Haven Realty should not be considered legal, tax, or financial advice. We strongly recommend consulting with qualified professionals in their respective fields before making any significant decisions related to real estate transactions. While we take reasonable measures to ensure the safety and security of our website and systems, we cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorized access, viruses, or other malicious activities.

However, we cannot be held responsible for any disputes, misunderstandings, or legal issues that may arise between buyers, sellers, or other parties involved in real estate transactions facilitated through our platform. In the realm of real estate, visual representations such as photographs, virtual tours, and video walkthroughs play a crucial role in showcasing properties. At Cat Haven Realty, we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date visual materials to our clients. However, it is important to note that these visuals are intended for illustrative purposes only and may not reflect the current condition or appearance of the property. Furthermore, the visual materials provided by Cat Haven Realty are subject to the artistic interpretation and stylistic choices of the photographers, videographers, or virtual tour providers. These visuals may be enhanced, edited, or digitally altered to improve their quality or highlight specific features of the property. As such, the visual representations should not be considered as an absolute representation of the property's condition or an implied warranty. We strongly advise our clients to schedule physical viewings or inspections of any properties they are interested in, as this will provide the most accurate and up-to-date assessment of the property's condition, features, and surroundings. Relying solely on visual materials without conducting proper due diligence may lead to misunderstandings or unrealistic expectations. It is essential to understand that the real estate market is constantly evolving, and properties may undergo changes, renovations, or alterations over time. As such, the visual materials provided by Cat Haven Realty may not reflect the most recent updates or modifications to a property. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by third-party sources, such as property descriptions, neighborhood profiles, or community amenities. While we strive to verify and cross-reference such information, we encourage our clients to conduct their own research and consult with relevant authorities or professionals to ensure the accuracy of any critical information. At Cat Haven Realty, we prioritize transparency and strive to provide our clients with the best possible service. However, we cannot be held responsible for any discrepancies, inaccuracies, or misrepresentations that may arise from the visual materials or third-party information provided. We strongly encourage our clients to exercise due diligence, seek professional advice when necessary, and make informed decisions based on their own research and findings. At Cat Haven Realty, we understand the significance of community in the real estate industry. Our website and marketing materials may feature information about local neighborhoods, amenities, schools, and community events.

Community dynamics, statistics, and offerings are subject to change over time, and it is essential to verify any critical details directly with the relevant authorities or service providers. Additionally, any opinions, reviews, or ratings provided by third parties or community members regarding specific neighborhoods, amenities, or services should be evaluated with caution. Cat Haven Realty does not endorse or validate the accuracy or truthfulness of such subjective assessments, as they may reflect personal biases, experiences, or perspectives. It is important to note that Cat Haven Realty does not have direct control over the operations, maintenance, or management of any community facilities, services, or events mentioned on our website or marketing materials. We provide this information as a courtesy to our clients, but we cannot be held responsible for any changes, disruptions, or issues that may arise within these community offerings. Furthermore, we advise our clients to conduct their own research and due diligence when evaluating the suitability of a particular community or neighborhood for their specific needs and preferences.
