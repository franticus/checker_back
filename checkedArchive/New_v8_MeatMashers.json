Ensure everything is securely attached. Step 2: Prepare Your Meat Cut your meat into small chunks or strips that will fit easily into the grinder's feeding tube. Remove any bones, tendons, or excess fat. Step 3: Start Grinding Turn on your grinder and begin feeding the prepared meat into the feeding tube. Use the included pusher to push the meat down and ensure a steady flow. Step 4: Collect Your Ground Meat As the meat is ground, it will be expelled through the grinder's output chute. Collect the ground meat in a bowl or container as it comes out. Step 5: Clean and Store Once you're finished grinding, disassemble the grinder and clean each part thoroughly with warm, soapy water. Allow them to dry completely before reassembling or storing. What Our Customers Say John D. \"The GrindMaster 1000 has transformed my kitchen. It’s incredibly efficient and easy to use.
