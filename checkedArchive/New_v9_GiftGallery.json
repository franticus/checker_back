How GiftGallery was born The story of GiftGallery begins in 2015, when two friends from India decided to start a business together. They had both been traveling to India for many years, falling in love with the culture, artisans and traditions of this beautiful country. They realized that there was a demand for authentic Indian handmade gifts and souvenirs in the international market, but the options were limited and often of poor quality. They decided to fill this gap and started GiftGallery, a platform for Indian artisans to showcase their wares and connect with a global audience.
