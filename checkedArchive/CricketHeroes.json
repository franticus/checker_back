A fantasy cricket match is based on batting and bowling orders, which are the most debated part of cricketing strategy. A small change in the order can change the course of the game. The concept involves selecting a team of 11 players and 3 substitutes from the pool of players who play the match. There are no budget caps and player selection is not limited to a particular number of batters, bowlers and all-rounders although in some fantasy applications you can only create team according to their prerequisite patterns. An example of their given pattern could be 5 batters, 1 wicket-keeper, 2 all-rounders, 3 bowlers. A fantasy team can have any type of players. The main aim in a fantasy cricket match is to outscore the opposition by as large of a margin as possible. Fantasy cricket matches can be played in all three international forms: One Day International, Twenty20 and Test Cricket. The limited over matches, namely the One Day Internationals and Twenty20s, are played in two formats – daily games and rounds.
