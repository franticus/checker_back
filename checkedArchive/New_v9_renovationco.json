We are committed to continuous improvement and welcome feedback from our clients to help us enhance the quality of our services. Client Responsibilities To ensure the efficient delivery of renovation services, clients have several responsibilities. Firstly, clients must provide RenovationCo with access to the property at the agreed-upon times. This includes ensuring that keys, security codes, or other necessary means of entry are made available to our renovation team. Clients must also ensure that the area to be renovated is accessible and free from excessive clutter or hazards that could impede the renovation process. Clients are responsible for securing all personal belongings and valuables before the renovation service begins. RenovationCo recommends that clients remove or safely store any items of significant value or importance, as we cannot be held liable for any loss or damage to unsecured items. This includes but is not limited to jewelry, electronics, cash, and important documents. Clients should inform RenovationCo of any specific renovation preferences, allergies, or sensitive areas in advance. This allows us to tailor our services to meet your unique needs and preferences. Additionally, clients should notify RenovationCo of any maintenance or safety issues that could affect the renovation process or pose a risk to our team. Failure to provide accurate information may result in suboptimal service delivery. Payment Terms Payment for RenovationCo's services is expected as outlined in the service agreement. We offer various payment methods for your convenience, including credit card payments, online bank transfers, and other secure payment options. Payment terms, including the schedule and amount, will be specified in the service agreement. Full payment is typically required upon completion of the service, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. Invoices for services rendered will be provided to clients electronically or in hard copy, as preferred. Clients are required to review the invoice for accuracy and notify RenovationCo of any discrepancies within 7 days of receipt. Failure to make timely payments may result in late fees, interest charges, or suspension of services until the outstanding balance is settled. RenovationCo reserves the right to implement changes to our pricing structure or payment policies. Clients will be informed of any such changes in advance, and existing agreements will be honored until their completion. We strive to maintain transparent and fair pricing for all our services, ensuring that our clients receive value for their investment in our professional renovation services. Cancellation Policy Clients wishing to cancel or reschedule a renovation service are required to provide at least 24 hours' notice. This allows RenovationCo to adjust our schedule and allocate resources effectively. Cancellations or rescheduling requests made with less than 24 hours' notice may incur a cancellation fee, as specified in the service agreement. The cancellation fee is intended to cover the costs associated with the lost opportunity to serve other clients and preparation expenses. RenovationCo recognizes that emergencies and unforeseen circumstances can arise. We will make every effort to accommodate reasonable requests for rescheduling without penalty. However, repeated cancellations or rescheduling may affect future bookings and the availability of preferred time slots. RenovationCo reserves the right to cancel or reschedule services due to factors beyond our control, such as severe weather, natural disasters, or other emergencies. In such cases, clients will be notified as soon as possible, and efforts will be made to reschedule the service at a mutually convenient time. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in these situations.

In the event of a claim arising from our services, RenovationCo's total liability is limited to the amount paid by the client for the specific service in question.
