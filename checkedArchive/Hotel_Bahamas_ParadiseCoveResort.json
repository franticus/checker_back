Our History Paradise Cove Resort has a storied past, dating back to its founding in the 1950s. Over the decades, it has evolved from a small seaside inn into a luxurious destination, known for its exceptional service and stunning surroundings. Our commitment to providing a memorable experience for our guests has been unwavering, and we continue to uphold the traditions of excellence that have defined us for generations. In the 1970s, Paradise Cove underwent its first major expansion, adding new amenities and accommodations to meet the growing demand from tourists. This period marked the beginning of our transformation into a premier resort, with the addition of a fine dining restaurant and the first of many guest entertainment options. The 1980s and 1990s saw further enhancements, including the introduction of our world-class spa and wellness center. These decades also brought a focus on sustainability and environmental stewardship, with initiatives to protect our beautiful coastal environment and support local communities. In the 2000s, we embraced technological advancements, integrating modern conveniences while preserving the charm and elegance that our guests cherish. High-speed internet, smart room controls, and a state-of-the-art booking system are just a few of the improvements that have enhanced the guest experience. Today, Paradise Cove Resort remains a beloved destination for travelers from around the world. We continue to innovate and improve, always with an eye towards maintaining the rich heritage and exceptional standards that have been our hallmark for over half a century.
