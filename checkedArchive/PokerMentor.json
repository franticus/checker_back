Cashouts Hinder Progression: One of the main reasons for slow progress through the poker limits is frequent cashouts. If a player makes regular cashouts, it can delay their advancement to the next limit by several months or more. Consistent Limit Advancement: A backing fund offers players the opportunity to move up the limits regardless of cashouts or downswings in their poker game. The speed of climbing the limits depends solely on the player's current skill level. Support for Higher Limits: When a participant is ready to play at a higher limit, we provide the necessary conditions. These conditions allow them to fully realize their potential and achieve success in poker. Rapid Advancement Potential: With the right circumstances and minimal variance interference, a player can move from NL20 to NL100 within 2-3 months. Upon completing the contract, you'll have the opportunity to play independently at mid-level limits with a sufficient skill level to be successful. No Initial Investment Required: Training with the Backing Fund requires no financial investment from you. We fund your play and provide the conditions necessary to move to the next limit. This way, you can progress through each limit in as little as 2 weeks to 2 months. How Does the Training and Backing Process Work in Poker? Access to Training Resources: You'll gain access to a dashboard with training videos and statistics, providing excellent conditions for poker play. Homework and Game Analysis: To unlock the next lesson, the coach reviews your homework and analyzes your online poker gameplay. Regular Performance Reviews: Every 10k hands, the coach reviews your played hands database. If all criteria are met, your balance is topped up for playing at a higher limit. Continuous Cycle: This cycle repeats continuously, ensuring consistent development and progression through the poker limits.

Personal fund Contact Welcome to the Thrilling World of Poker POKER FUND: CREATE YOUR PERSONAL FUND WITH OUR HELP If poker is more than just a game to you, you can create your own personal poker fund with PokerMentor and build your team of players. This offer is especially relevant for online poker coaches. We take care of the profitable deals, operational work, experience, and even player balances, allowing you to focus on filling the fund with players and overseeing the training process. You manage the fund exclusively, and the responsibility for decisions remains with you. Submit your request WE INVITE STAKING POKER FUNDS, POKER SCHOOLS, AND POKER COACHES TO COLLABORATE What is the cost of training players at NL2, NL5 - $3, $5, or $15? And how much do players at these limits earn per month - $50, $70, or $100? Now, let's consider mobile club poker apps, where the competition is much weaker. This means an NL2 player from a regular room can comfortably play at the NL10 limit in apps, and an NL5 player can comfortably play at the NL20 limit. If players improve their skills, they can play at even higher limits and win against even stronger opponents. Only those who are diligent and forward-thinking can earn as much passively as they do actively by conducting training for a fixed fee. An \"active approach\" means working here and now. A \"passive approach\" is the result of cumulative actions and, in the long run, does not depend on immediate efforts.
